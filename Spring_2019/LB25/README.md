**Title**: Introduction to Cloud Computing

**Abstract**: 
Cloud computing allows you to access compute resources on demand. 
You get exactly what you need, and pay only for what you use.
While most of us have used the cloud indirectly for email, 
file storage, or personal websites, the concept of cloud 
computing for scientific research is still somewhat opaque.
If you were ever stuck in a shared supercomputer queue for 
days while in a time crunch, cloud computing could help.
If you have a simulation that is too big for your computer's memory,
but don't want to purchase new hardware only for that one simulation,
you could easily rent a large computer in the cloud.
Most small lab supercomputers are used at peak capacity in 
occasional bursts, and otherwise sit idle for the rest of the year.
This creates an unnecessary waste of energy and research funds.
In this Lunch Byte, I will show you how to start with cloud computing 
for your work, and give you a tour of my favorite cloud provider.
