**Speaker**: Suvarchal Kumar (RSMAS)

**Title**: Hosting and managing your geophysical datasets

**Abstract**: Wish you had an efficient content management system 
for your earth-science data? Then you might be interested in RAMADDA, 
a content management system for earth-science data. 
Using our locally hosted repository, weather.rsmas.miami.edu/repository, 
I will show examples of how we use the repository and how you 
can also use the services of the repository. 
If you would like to see how this might work for your data, 
bring small samples of your data and have python package manager pip 
or conda installed on your laptop.
For those interested, I will show the easiest way to host your own 
server with data repository and services shown in the examples.

**When**: Friday, August 31, 12-1 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
