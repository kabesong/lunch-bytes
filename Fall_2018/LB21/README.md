**Title**: Making beautiful plots with Python's matplotlib [Slides](https://goo.gl/BC6X8D)

**Abstract**: Do you want to convert a dataset into beautiful publication quality figures ? Then you might be interested in this seminar focusing on matplotlib, the main python plotting library. It provides a MATLAB-like interface, easy to learn for everyone who uses MATLAB, and gives full control of the figure style via an object oriented interface. The goal of the seminar will be to provide an overview of useful plotting tools for atmospheric and ocean sciences from basic examples (trajectory, profile, histogram, contour) to more complex ones (meshplot, collections). Finally, we will experiment with cartopy, a mapping library built on top of matplotlib regrouping various tools to present geospatial data (model, remote sensing) onto different projections. Along the way, you will learn different advice and tips on how to customize the different style components of a figure. To follow along during the seminar, bring a laptop with Anaconda installed.
