**Title**: Introduction to NCAR Command Language (NCL) for Climate Data Analysis

**Abstract**: NCAR Command Language (NCL) is a free interpreted language 
designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization, 
facilitated by NCAR.  NCL supports many of the file types you may be 
used to working with, such as NetCDF, GRIB, HDF, shapefiles, ASCII, 
and binary – all with ease! NCL has analysis functions built-in, 
including those specifically related to earth science needs such 
as drought indices, heat-stress indices, etc., math and statistics, 
array manipulation, regridding, and file input/output. 
NCL can also easily create customizable high quality graphics, 
and has a large amount of example scripts and an active user base 
to help you when needed. We will be going over an introduction to 
NCL and some simple analysis of climate data. 
Beginners are welcome. If you would like to follow along, 
NCL is available on University of Miami VIS and Pegasus 
supercomputing environments (ncl/6.1.2).
