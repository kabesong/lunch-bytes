**Title**:Â Applying Machine Learning to Satellite Remote Sensing Data

**Abstract**: This seminar will provide a short introduction to machine
learning theory and techniques, from Bayesian decision theory, to
perceptrons, and "Deep Learning". The goal is not to cover the math in
detail, as has been done in many seminars before, but to discuss
practicalities: when it comes to applying machine learning to satellite
data, how do we prepare the data? How do we decide what model to use?
What frameworks are available? How do we train the models? How do we
evaluate our models? And what models best suit specific problems we
might encounter as satellite data end users? At the end of the seminar,
I hope that the audience will have a better understanding of how to
apply machine learning techniques to their work.

**When**: Friday, October 5, 12 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
