**Speaker**: Matt Grossi (RSMAS/UM)

**Title**: Peeking under the hood of an artificial neural network

**Abstract**: What exactly is a neural network and how does it work?  What kind of problems can such a model be used for?  Though undeniably popular and remarkably successful at handling many complex problems, neural networks are often criticized as being black boxes from which little insight can be drawn.  To what extent is this objection true?  Must the deeply curious scientist simply accept neural networks as mysterious boxes of “mathemagic?”  This week we will look under the hood of a simple neural network to explore these important questions and try to understand what actually goes on inside the model.

**When**: Friday, October 26, 12 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
