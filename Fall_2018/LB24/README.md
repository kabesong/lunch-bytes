**Title**: What I've learned from Waterlust: Launching your passion project while in graduate school and turning it into a career...hopefully

**Abstract**: Graduate school offers students a unique period of time to develop 
“passion projects” that are related to their research. Despite academic commitments 
that increase exponentially as one approaches graduation, I argue that “studenthood” 
is generally free from common later-in-life complexities that make launching a new 
endeavor challenging and unlikely. I will draw from my experience founding Waterlust, 
a purpose-driven apparel brand that evolved during my years as a PhD student. 
In the discussion I will attempt to identify key strategies that have enabled 
it to grow into a profitable company that was capable of employing me upon 
graduation and becoming my career. Specifically I will focus on:

* Developing your project’s idea 
* Separating your ego from your goals
* Finding project soulmates
* Establishing and building an audience
* Leveraging opportunity
* Creating a financial model
* How to grow (or die trying)  

**When**: Friday, December 7, 12 pm.
