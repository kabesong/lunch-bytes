**Speaker**: Brian McNoldy (RSMAS/UM)

**Title**: Sharing Science with Scientists and the Public

**Abstract**: Brian has a history with creating websites 
that goes back 24 years (remember when graphical web browsers didn't exist?), 
and those sites have all been geared toward sharing interesting "science-y" things with people, 
from fractals to planets to hurricanes. He will also talk about the languages and tools 
he uses to keep numerous real-time products running. 
The current iteration of his website is located [here](http://andrew.rsmas.miami.edu/bmcnoldy).
On the more visible outreach front, he has maintained a blog on Atlantic 
hurricane activity since 1996, has been the tropical weather expert 
for the Washington Post since 2012, and founded the "Canes on Canes" hurricane 
outreach program at RSMAS in 2014. He'll offer some pointers on how to 
effectively engage the public when talking about topics in science.

**When**: Friday, September 7, 12-1 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
