**Speaker**: Brian Mapes (RSMAS/UM)

**Title**: Load, don’t code: Online plotting and analysis using NASA Giovanni, KNMI Climate Explorer, NOAA PSD pages, or LDEO Ingrid 

**Abstract**: Sometimes a data display or even analysis can be done 
quickly in a browser, your interface to the machine where the data 
are already all set up with tools. This is not “the cloud”, 
where you need an account, and still have to write code. 
It’s free (as in beer) point-and-click portals, 
with a fair amount of power behind them. 

I will briefly survey and demo a few of my favorites for weather and climate and satellite data: 

1. Giovanni, now federated across NASA multiple data centers, 
part of GES-DISC tools whose User Committee I’d love to channel 
your comments to... https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni.
2. NOAA PSD, my former institution, 
https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/cgi-bin/data/getpage.pl.
3. Climate Explorer at KNMI (Netherlands). 
High powered statistics and lots of data.

4. Ingrid at LDEO, http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu.

**When**: Friday, November 9, 12 pm.

**Where**: MSC 343 (classroom closest to the elevator)
